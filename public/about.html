<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, I’m Ed Gadi, an aspiring web developer passionate about creating dynamic and engaging websites. I’m currently honing my skills in front-end and back-end development, with a strong focus on learning the latest technologies and best practices in the field. My journey into web development started with a fascination for how the web works, and now I’m dedicated to turning that passion into a successful career.</p>

<p>I believe that hard work, persistence, and a love for problem-solving are the keys to achieving my goals. While I’m still on the path to mastering the art of web development, I’m excited to collaborate with others, learn from industry experts, and contribute to meaningful projects.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring new tech trends, brainstorming creative ideas, or diving into online courses to expand my knowledge.

  I’m looking forward to growing in this field and working on innovative web solutions that make a real impact. Thanks for stopping by.</p>
